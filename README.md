# Project Title: basic_shape_drawing

**Overview:**

This project serves as a learning exercise in utilizing SDL2 to draw various shapes. Through this project, I successfully implemented the drawing of rectangles, filled rectangles, and circles.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Drawing Rectangles**: Drawing rectangles was achieved straightforwardly using the `SDL_RenderDrawRect()` function.

- **Drawing Circles**: For drawing circles, I employed the Midpoint Circle Algorithm, a highly efficient method for circle rendering.

- **Smiley Face**: Utilizing the Midpoint Circle Algorithm for the face and eyes, and a quadratic function for the smiley mouth, I was able to draw a charming smiley face. These techniques not only proved effective but also provided an engaging learning experience.
